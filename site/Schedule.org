*** Evaluation Meeting 2

Ran and Jonathan present; other two nowhere to be found.

Items:
**** Changes in the course since last year.
***** 2012
- Moved from Master (served as a common ground in programming for
  students with various backgrounds -- the course was given to many
  international students)
- To Bachelor (most students had basic course in FP, OO, ...); the
  focus of the course is now to explain the links between the
  paradigms, and explain new concepts by translation into known (old)
  concepts.
***** 2013
- Different style of exercise sessions (less interactive)
- More course material produced
**** Study climate
- Good, maybe bad time for lectures in early morning
**** Problematic course items; can resources be used better?
- See below planned changes for next year.
- Should know earlier which exercises are relevant.
**** Course-specific questions in questionnaire; other material for final meeting?
- No extra material
*** Evaluation Meeting 3   

* TODO Next year
- Make one "admin" page; index just for announce and links.
- FP1: Algebraic Types, Pattern matching, Parametric types, Currification & HOF
- FP2: Polymorphic functions Translating away HOF (Inlining, Closures)
- FP3: Explicit state and laziness
- Write the solution for all questions/exercises in the lecture notes
- Publish the complete code for answers
